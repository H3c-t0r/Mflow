Installing MLflow
=================

There are different ways to install mlflow:

* Install the latest official release from PyPI. This is the best approach for most users.
  * Python: (``pip install mlflow``) or conda-forge
  (``conda install -c conda-forge mlflow``).
* Building the package from source, as described in the `Contributor Guide <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst.>`_
  This is best for developers who wish to contribute to MLflow, or users who want the latest-and-greatest features and arenâ€™t afraid of running brand-new code.
