Welcome to the CLI v2 workshop.


# Environment setup

In this workshop, we'll use a compute instance as the local environment, clone a GitHub repo and create a conda environment

## Create an AzureML compute instance as your environment

Pick a test workspace of your choice, create a compute instance (or your an exiting one if you have).

If you're creating a new compute instance, the default settings are good enough.
