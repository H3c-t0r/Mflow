    "# MLflow Trace Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a notebook for testing MLflow Trace APIs. Currently this implements a set of Python APIs for creating trace/spans, and show the basic UI of rendeing traces in notebook cells. The primary purpose of this notebook is to gather early feedbacks for the APIs and the UI and find any broken pieces before the official private preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### === Overview ===\n",
    "In this prototype, we have implemented the following set of Python APIs:\n",
    "* **Fluent APIs** - for instrumenting Python code without managing parent-child relationship of spans i.e. MLflow will determine the appropriate parent span based on the block scope. The general recommendation is to use fluent API as much as possbile if you can.\n",
    "* **MLflow Client APIs** - MlflowClient equips similar but more imperative APIs for more advanced use cases like multithreading, callbacks, etc, where you need to manually define the lifecycle of spans and parent-child relationship. For example, if you want to log trace with LangChain callback, you canâ€™t use fluent APIs because component start and end hooks need to be defined as different functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a span with those APIs, it will return a **MLflowSpanWrapper** object, which is an interface to mutate the span object. For example, you can call `set_attributes` method to record additional key-values for the span. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### === Fluent APIs ===\n",
    "There are 3 ways for defining spans using fluent APIs.\n",
    "1. Decorate a function with `@mlflow.trace`. This is useful when you want to create a span for your own functions.\n",
    "2. Wrap a function with `mlflow.trace()`. This is useful when you want to create a span for external libraries.\n",
    "3. Use context manager `with mlflow.start_span()`. This is useful when you want to define more granular spans within a single function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please vist the following docstring link for the API spec and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [mlflow.trace()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/1979b5b9a155c91675b62e759e51a5dbc628203a/mlflow/tracing/fluent.py#L17)\n",
    "* [mlflow.start_span](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/1979b5b9a155c91675b62e759e51a5dbc628203a/mlflow/tracing/fluent.py#L83)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Caputuring Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "If you are using the `@mlflow.trace` decorator or the `mlflow.trace()` wrapper for a function, it will automatically capture the input argument(s) and return value(s) for the function, setting them to `inputs` and `outputs` fields of the span respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `with mlflow.start_span()` context manager, you have to manually set `inputs` and `outputs` if you want to record them. This can be done by using `set_inputs()` and `set_outpus()` method of MLflowSpanWrapper object that is returned from the fluent API. Please see **MMLflowSpanWrapper** section below for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### === MLflow Client APIs ===\n",
    "MLflowClient exposes a new set of tracing APIs. As mentioned above, those APIs require explicit parent span ID specification to build the parent-child relationship, in contrast to the fluent APIs. Please refer to the following docstring link for the API spec and arguments. Also you can refer to the callback implementation example in the bottom of notebook for the usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [MLflowClient().start_trace()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/1979b5b9a155c91675b62e759e51a5dbc628203a/mlflow/tracking/client.py#L443)\n",
    "* [MLflowClient().end_trace()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/1979b5b9a155c91675b62e759e51a5dbc628203a/mlflow/tracking/client.py#L501)\n",
    "* [MLflowClient().start_span()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/1979b5b9a155c91675b62e759e51a5dbc628203a/mlflow/tracking/client.py#L531)\n",
    "* [MLflowClient().end_span()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/1979b5b9a155c91675b62e759e51a5dbc628203a/mlflow/tracking/client.py#L619)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### === MLflowSpanWrapper ===\n",
    "MLflowSpanWrapper provides a set of setter methods to manually mutate the span fields. Some of them are automatically recorded, such as span id, parent span id, start and end time, etc, but sometimes we need manual setting as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `set_inputs()`: Set input variables of the span\n",
    "* `set_outputs()`: Set output result of the span\n",
    "* `set_attributes()`: Add additional attributes to the span e.g. token count.\n",
    "* `set_status()`: Manually set status of the span. Common status change e.g. OK, Error, is handled automatically so you don't have to set it for typical scenario.\n",
    "* `add_event()`: Record point of time event to the span.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the usage example, please refer to the **Ex.3** code sample below. The source code for those APIs can be found at [MLflow repository](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/tracing/mlflow/tracing/types/wrapper.py#L12).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### === Examples ===\n",

    "**Ex.1**\n",

It offers a centralized model store, APIs, and UI to collaboratively manage an MLflow Model\\\\u2019s full lifecycle, including model lineage, versioning, aliasing, tagging, and annotations. MLflow Deployments for LLMs: This server, equipped with a set of standardized APIs, streamlines access to both SaaS and OSS LLM models. It serves as a unified interface, bolstering security through authenticated access, and offers a common set of APIs for prominent LLMs. Evaluate: Designed for in-depth model analysis, this set of tools facilitates objective model comparison, be it traditional ML algorithms or cutting-edge LLMs. Prompt Engineering UI: A dedicated environment for prompt engineering, this UI-centric component provides a space for prompt experimentation, refinement, evaluation, testing, and deployment. Recipes: Serving as a guide for structuring ML projects, Recipes, while offering recommendations, are focused on ensuring functional end results optimized for real-world deployment scenarios. Projects: MLflow Projects standardize the packaging of ML code, workflows, and artifacts, akin to an executable. Each project, be it a directory with code or a Git repository, employs a descriptor or convention to define its dependencies and execution method.  By integrating these core components, MLflow offers an end-to-end platform, ensuring efficiency, consistency, and traceability throughout the ML lifecycle.   Why Use MLflow?  The machine learning (ML) process is intricate, comprising various stages, from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring. Ensuring productivity and efficiency throughout this lifecycle poses several challenges:  Experiment Management: It\\\\u2019s tough to keep track of the myriad experiments, especially when working with files or interactive notebooks. Determining which combination of data, code, and parameters led to a particular result can become a daunting task. Reproducibility: Ensuring consistent results across runs is not trivial. Beyond just tracking code versions and parameters, capturing the entire environment, including library dependencies, is critical. This becomes even more challenging when collaborating with other data scientists or when scaling the code to different platforms. Deployment Consistency: With the plethora of ML libraries available, there\\\\u2019s often no standardized way to package and deploy models. Custom solutions can lead to inconsistencies, and the crucial link between a model and the code and parameters that produced it might be lost. Model Management: As data science teams produce numerous models, managing, testing, and continuously deploying these models becomes a significant hurdle. Without a centralized platform, managing model lifecycles becomes unwieldy. Library Agnosticism: While individual ML libraries might offer solutions to some of the challenges, achieving the best results often involves experimenting across multiple libraries. A platform that offers compatibility with various libraries while ensuring models are usable as reproducible \\\\u201cblack boxes\\\\u201d is essential.  MLflow addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform tailored for the entire ML lifecycle. Its benefits include:  Traceability: With tools like the Tracking Server, every experiment is logged, ensuring that teams can trace back and understand the evolution of models. Consistency: Be it accessing models through the MLflow Deployments for LLMs or structuring projects with MLflow Recipes, MLflow promotes a consistent approach, reducing both the learning curve and potential errors. Flexibility: MLflow\\\\u2019s library-agnostic design ensures compatibility with a wide range of machine learning libraries. It offers comprehensive support across different programming languages, backed by a robust REST API, CLI, and APIs for Python API, R API, and Java API.  By simplifying the complex landscape of ML workflows, MLflow empowers data scientists and developers to focus on building and refining models, ensuring a streamlined path from experimentation to production.

Create a new directory for your custom pyfunc model. This directory should contain the following files:\\\\n* `MLmodel`: A configuration file that specifies the model type and any necessary dependencies.\\\\n* `conda.yaml`: A configuration file that specifies the Conda environment needed to run your model.\\\\n* `model.py`: A Python module that defines your custom pyfunc model class.\\\\n2. In the `MLmodel` file, specify the model type as `pyfunc` and list any necessary dependencies. For example:\\\\n```makefile\\\\nmodel_type: pyfunc\\\\n\\\\ndependencies:\\\\n  - python=3.8\\\\n  - pip:\\\\n    - mlflow\\\\n    - numpy\\\\n    - pandas\\\\n```\\\\n3.

It offers a centralized model store, APIs, and UI to collaboratively manage an MLflow Model\\\\u2019s full lifecycle, including model lineage, versioning, aliasing, tagging, and annotations. MLflow Deployments for LLMs: This server, equipped with a set of standardized APIs, streamlines access to both SaaS and OSS LLM models. It serves as a unified interface, bolstering security through authenticated access, and offers a common set of APIs for prominent LLMs. Evaluate: Designed for in-depth model analysis, this set of tools facilitates objective model comparison, be it traditional ML algorithms or cutting-edge LLMs. Prompt Engineering UI: A dedicated environment for prompt engineering, this UI-centric component provides a space for prompt experimentation, refinement, evaluation, testing, and deployment. Recipes: Serving as a guide for structuring ML projects, Recipes, while offering recommendations, are focused on ensuring functional end results optimized for real-world deployment scenarios. Projects: MLflow Projects standardize the packaging of ML code, workflows, and artifacts, akin to an executable. Each project, be it a directory with code or a Git repository, employs a descriptor or convention to define its dependencies and execution method.  By integrating these core components, MLflow offers an end-to-end platform, ensuring efficiency, consistency, and traceability throughout the ML lifecycle.   Why Use MLflow?  The machine learning (ML) process is intricate, comprising various stages, from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring. Ensuring productivity and efficiency throughout this lifecycle poses several challenges:  Experiment Management: It\\\\u2019s tough to keep track of the myriad experiments, especially when working with files or interactive notebooks. Determining which combination of data, code, and parameters led to a particular result can become a daunting task. Reproducibility: Ensuring consistent results across runs is not trivial. Beyond just tracking code versions and parameters, capturing the entire environment, including library dependencies, is critical. This becomes even more challenging when collaborating with other data scientists or when scaling the code to different platforms. Deployment Consistency: With the plethora of ML libraries available, there\\\\u2019s often no standardized way to package and deploy models. Custom solutions can lead to inconsistencies, and the crucial link between a model and the code and parameters that produced it might be lost. Model Management: As data science teams produce numerous models, managing, testing, and continuously deploying these models becomes a significant hurdle. Without a centralized platform, managing model lifecycles becomes unwieldy. Library Agnosticism: While individual ML libraries might offer solutions to some of the challenges, achieving the best results often involves experimenting across multiple libraries. A platform that offers compatibility with various libraries while ensuring models are usable as reproducible \\\\u201cblack boxes\\\\u201d is essential.  MLflow addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform tailored for the entire ML lifecycle. Its benefits include:  Traceability: With tools like the Tracking Server, every experiment is logged, ensuring that teams can trace back and understand the evolution of models. Consistency: Be it accessing models through the MLflow Deployments for LLMs or structuring projects with MLflow Recipes, MLflow promotes a consistent approach, reducing both the learning curve and potential errors. Flexibility: MLflow\\\\u2019s library-agnostic design ensures compatibility with a wide range of machine learning libraries. It offers comprehensive support across different programming languages, backed by a robust REST API, CLI, and APIs for Python API, R API, and Java API.  By simplifying the complex landscape of ML workflows, MLflow empowers data scientists and developers to focus on building and refining models, ensuring a streamlined path from experimentation to production.

Determining which combination of data, code, and parameters led to a particular result can become a daunting task. Reproducibility: Ensuring consistent results across runs is not trivial. Beyond just tracking code versions and parameters, capturing the entire environment, including library dependencies, is critical. This becomes even more challenging when collaborating with other data scientists or when scaling the code to different platforms. Deployment Consistency: With the plethora of ML libraries available, there\\\\u2019s often no standardized way to package and deploy models. Custom solutions can lead to inconsistencies, and the crucial link between a model and the code and parameters that produced it might be lost. Model Management: As data science teams produce numerous models, managing, testing, and continuously deploying these models becomes a significant hurdle. Without a centralized platform, managing model lifecycles becomes unwieldy. Library Agnosticism: While individual ML libraries might offer solutions to some of the challenges, achieving the best results often involves experimenting across multiple libraries. A platform that offers compatibility with various libraries while ensuring models are usable as reproducible \\\\u201cblack boxes\\\\u201d is essential.  MLflow addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform tailored for the entire ML lifecycle. Its benefits include:  Traceability: With tools like the Tracking Server, every experiment is logged, ensuring that teams can trace back and understand the evolution of models. Consistency: Be it accessing models through the MLflow Deployments for LLMs or structuring projects with MLflow Recipes, MLflow promotes a consistent approach, reducing both the learning curve and potential errors. Flexibility: MLflow\\\\u2019s library-agnostic design ensures compatibility with a wide range of machine learning libraries. It offers comprehensive support across different programming languages, backed by a robust REST API, CLI, and APIs for Python API, R API, and Java API.  By simplifying the complex landscape of ML workflows, MLflow empowers data scientists and developers to focus on building and refining models, ensuring a streamlined path from experimentation to production.   Who Uses MLflow?  Throughout the lifecycle of a particular project, there are components within MLflow that are designed to cater to different needs.

Crafting custom prompts and persisting their candidate creations. Deciding on the best base model suitable for their specific project requirements.     Use Cases of MLflow  MLflow is versatile, catering to diverse machine learning scenarios. Here are some typical use cases:  Experiment Tracking: A data science team leverages MLflow Tracking to log parameters and metrics for experiments within a particular domain. Using the MLflow UI, they can compare results and fine-tune their solution approach. The outcomes of these experiments are preserved as MLflow models. Model Selection and Deployment: MLOps engineers employ the MLflow UI to assess and pick the top-performing models. The chosen model is registered in the MLflow Registry, allowing for monitoring its real-world performance. Model Performance Monitoring: Post deployment, MLOps engineers utilize the MLflow Registry to gauge the model\\\\u2019s efficacy, juxtaposing it against other models in a live environment. Collaborative Projects: Data scientists embarking on new ventures organize their work as an MLflow Project. This structure facilitates easy sharing and parameter modifications, promoting collaboration.    Scalability in MLflow  MLflow is architected to seamlessly integrate with diverse data environments, from small datasets to Big Data applications. It\\\\u2019s built with the understanding that quality machine learning outcomes often hinge on robust data sources, and as such, scales adeptly to accommodate varying data needs. Here\\\\u2019s how MLflow addresses scalability across different dimensions:  Distributed Execution: MLflow runs can operate on distributed clusters. For instance, integration with Apache Spark allows for distributed processing. Furthermore, runs can be initiated on the distributed infrastructure of your preference, with results relayed to a centralized Tracking Server for analysis. Notably, MLflow offers an integrated API to initiate runs on Databricks. Parallel Runs: For use cases like hyperparameter tuning, MLflow can orchestrate multiple runs simultaneously, each with distinct parameters. Interoperability with Distributed Storage: MLflow Projects can interface with distributed storage solutions, including Azure ADLS, Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, Cloudflare R2 and DBFS. Whether it\\\\u2019s automatically fetching files to a local environment or interfacing with a distributed storage URI directly, MLflow ensures that projects can handle extensive datasets \\\\u2013 even scenarios like processing a 100 TB file. Centralized Model Management with Model Registry: Large-scale organizations can benefit from the MLflow Model Registry, a unified platform tailored for collaborative model lifecycle management. In environments where multiple data science teams might be concurrently developing numerous models, the Model Registry proves invaluable. It streamlines model discovery, tracks experiments, manages versions, and facilitates understanding a model\\\\u2019s intent across different teams.  By addressing these scalability dimensions, MLflow ensures that users can capitalize on its capabilities regardless of their data environment\\\\u2019s size or complexity.

It offers a centralized model store, APIs, and UI to collaboratively manage an MLflow Model\\\\u2019s full lifecycle, including model lineage, versioning, aliasing, tagging, and annotations. MLflow Deployments for LLMs: This server, equipped with a set of standardized APIs, streamlines access to both SaaS and OSS LLM models. It serves as a unified interface, bolstering security through authenticated access, and offers a common set of APIs for prominent LLMs. Evaluate: Designed for in-depth model analysis, this set of tools facilitates objective model comparison, be it traditional ML algorithms or cutting-edge LLMs. Prompt Engineering UI: A dedicated environment for prompt engineering, this UI-centric component provides a space for prompt experimentation, refinement, evaluation, testing, and deployment. Recipes: Serving as a guide for structuring ML projects, Recipes, while offering recommendations, are focused on ensuring functional end results optimized for real-world deployment scenarios. Projects: MLflow Projects standardize the packaging of ML code, workflows, and artifacts, akin to an executable. Each project, be it a directory with code or a Git repository, employs a descriptor or convention to define its dependencies and execution method.  By integrating these core components, MLflow offers an end-to-end platform, ensuring efficiency, consistency, and traceability throughout the ML lifecycle.   Why Use MLflow?  The machine learning (ML) process is intricate, comprising various stages, from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring. Ensuring productivity and efficiency throughout this lifecycle poses several challenges:  Experiment Management: It\\\\u2019s tough to keep track of the myriad experiments, especially when working with files or interactive notebooks. Determining which combination of data, code, and parameters led to a particular result can become a daunting task. Reproducibility: Ensuring consistent results across runs is not trivial. Beyond just tracking code versions and parameters, capturing the entire environment, including library dependencies, is critical. This becomes even more challenging when collaborating with other data scientists or when scaling the code to different platforms. Deployment Consistency: With the plethora of ML libraries available, there\\\\u2019s often no standardized way to package and deploy models. Custom solutions can lead to inconsistencies, and the crucial link between a model and the code and parameters that produced it might be lost. Model Management: As data science teams produce numerous models, managing, testing, and continuously deploying these models becomes a significant hurdle. Without a centralized platform, managing model lifecycles becomes unwieldy. Library Agnosticism: While individual ML libraries might offer solutions to some of the challenges, achieving the best results often involves experimenting across multiple libraries. A platform that offers compatibility with various libraries while ensuring models are usable as reproducible \\\\u201cblack boxes\\\\u201d is essential.  MLflow addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform tailored for the entire ML lifecycle. Its benefits include:  Traceability: With tools like the Tracking Server, every experiment is logged, ensuring that teams can trace back and understand the evolution of models.

Determining which combination of data, code, and parameters led to a particular result can become a daunting task. Reproducibility: Ensuring consistent results across runs is not trivial. Beyond just tracking code versions and parameters, capturing the entire environment, including library dependencies, is critical. This becomes even more challenging when collaborating with other data scientists or when scaling the code to different platforms. Deployment Consistency: With the plethora of ML libraries available, there\\\\u2019s often no standardized way to package and deploy models. Custom solutions can lead to inconsistencies, and the crucial link between a model and the code and parameters that produced it might be lost. Model Management: As data science teams produce numerous models, managing, testing, and continuously deploying these models becomes a significant hurdle. Without a centralized platform, managing model lifecycles becomes unwieldy. Library Agnosticism: While individual ML libraries might offer solutions to some of the challenges, achieving the best results often involves experimenting across multiple libraries. A platform that offers compatibility with various libraries while ensuring models are usable as reproducible \\\\u201cblack boxes\\\\u201d is essential.  MLflow addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform tailored for the entire ML lifecycle.

Whether you\\u2019re an individual researcher, a member of a large team, or somewhere in between, MLflow provides a unified platform to navigate the intricate maze of model development, deployment, and management. MLflow aims to enable innovation in ML solution development by streamlining otherwise cumbersome logging, organization, and lineage concerns that are unique to model development. This focus allows you to ensure that your ML projects are robust, transparent, and ready for real-world challenges. Read on to discover the core components of MLflow and understand the unique advantages it brings to the complex workflows associated with model development and management.  Core Components of MLflow  MLflow, at its core, provides a suite of tools aimed at simplifying the ML workflow. It is tailored to assist ML practitioners throughout the various stages of ML development and deployment. Despite its expansive offerings, MLflow\\u2019s functionalities are rooted in several foundational components:  Tracking: MLflow Tracking provides both an API and UI dedicated to the logging of parameters, code versions, metrics, and artifacts during the ML process. This centralized repository captures details such as parameters, metrics, artifacts, data, and environment configurations, giving teams insight into their models\\u2019 evolution over time. Whether working in standalone scripts, notebooks, or other environments, Tracking facilitates the logging of results either to local files or a server, making it easier to compare multiple runs across different users. Model Registry: A systematic approach to model management, the Model Registry assists in handling different versions of models, discerning their current state, and ensuring smooth productionization. It offers a centralized model store, APIs, and UI to collaboratively manage an MLflow Model\\u2019s full lifecycle, including model lineage, versioning, aliasing, tagging, and annotations. MLflow Deployments for LLMs: This server, equipped with a set of standardized APIs, streamlines access to both SaaS and OSS LLM models. It serves as a unified interface, bolstering security through authenticated access, and offers a common set of APIs for prominent LLMs. Evaluate: Designed for in-depth model analysis, this set of tools facilitates objective model comparison, be it traditional ML algorithms or cutting-edge LLMs. Prompt Engineering UI: A dedicated environment for prompt engineering, this UI-centric component provides a space for prompt experimentation, refinement, evaluation, testing, and deployment. Recipes: Serving as a guide for structuring ML projects, Recipes, while offering recommendations, are focused on ensuring functional end results optimized for real-world deployment scenarios. Projects: MLflow Projects standardize the packaging of ML code, workflows, and artifacts, akin to an executable. Each project, be it a directory with code or a Git repository, employs a descriptor or convention to define its dependencies and execution method.  By integrating these core components, MLflow offers an end-to-end platform, ensuring efficiency, consistency, and traceability throughout the ML lifecycle.   Why Use MLflow?  The machine learning (ML) process is intricate, comprising various stages, from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring. Ensuring productivity and efficiency throughout this lifecycle poses several challenges:  Experiment Management: It\\u2019s tough to keep track of the myriad experiments, especially when working with files or interactive notebooks. Determining which combination of data, code, and parameters led to a particular result can become a daunting task. Reproducibility: Ensuring consistent results across runs is not trivial. Beyond just tracking code versions and parameters, capturing the entire environment, including library dependencies, is critical. This becomes even more challenging when collaborating with other data scientists or when scaling the code to different platforms. Deployment Consistency: With the plethora of ML libraries available, there\\u2019s often no standardized way to package and deploy models. Custom solutions can lead to inconsistencies, and the crucial link between a model and the code and parameters that produced it might be lost. Model Management: As data science teams produce numerous models, managing, testing, and continuously deploying these models becomes a significant hurdle. Without a centralized platform, managing model lifecycles becomes unwieldy.

It offers a centralized model store, APIs, and UI to collaboratively manage an MLflow Model\\\\u2019s full lifecycle, including model lineage, versioning, aliasing, tagging, and annotations. MLflow Deployments for LLMs: This server, equipped with a set of standardized APIs, streamlines access to both SaaS and OSS LLM models. It serves as a unified interface, bolstering security through authenticated access, and offers a common set of APIs for prominent LLMs. Evaluate: Designed for in-depth model analysis, this set of tools facilitates objective model comparison, be it traditional ML algorithms or cutting-edge LLMs. Prompt Engineering UI: A dedicated environment for prompt engineering, this UI-centric component provides a space for prompt experimentation, refinement, evaluation, testing, and deployment. Recipes: Serving as a guide for structuring ML projects, Recipes, while offering recommendations, are focused on ensuring functional end results optimized for real-world deployment scenarios. Projects: MLflow Projects standardize the packaging of ML code, workflows, and artifacts, akin to an executable. Each project, be it a directory with code or a Git repository, employs a descriptor or convention to define its dependencies and execution method.  By integrating these core components, MLflow offers an end-to-end platform, ensuring efficiency, consistency, and traceability throughout the ML lifecycle.   Why Use MLflow?  The machine learning (ML) process is intricate, comprising various stages, from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring. Ensuring productivity and efficiency throughout this lifecycle poses several challenges:  Experiment Management: It\\\\u2019s tough to keep track of the myriad experiments, especially when working with files or interactive notebooks. Determining which combination of data, code, and parameters led to a particular result can become a daunting task. Reproducibility: Ensuring consistent results across runs is not trivial. Beyond just tracking code versions and parameters, capturing the entire environment, including library dependencies, is critical. This becomes even more challenging when collaborating with other data scientists or when scaling the code to different platforms. Deployment Consistency: With the plethora of ML libraries available, there\\\\u2019s often no standardized way to package and deploy models. Custom solutions can lead to inconsistencies, and the crucial link between a model and the code and parameters that produced it might be lost. Model Management: As data science teams produce numerous models, managing, testing, and continuously deploying these models becomes a significant hurdle. Without a centralized platform, managing model lifecycles becomes unwieldy. Library Agnosticism: While individual ML libraries might offer solutions to some of the challenges, achieving the best results often involves experimenting across multiple libraries. A platform that offers compatibility with various libraries while ensuring models are usable as reproducible \\\\u201cblack boxes\\\\u201d is essential.  MLflow addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform tailored for the entire ML lifecycle. Its benefits include:  Traceability: With tools like the Tracking Server, every experiment is logged, ensuring that teams can trace back and understand the evolution of models. Consistency: Be it accessing models through the MLflow Deployments for LLMs or structuring projects with MLflow Recipes, MLflow promotes a consistent approach, reducing both the learning curve and potential errors. Flexibility: MLflow\\\\u2019s library-agnostic design ensures compatibility with a wide range of machine learning libraries. It offers comprehensive support across different programming languages, backed by a robust REST API, CLI, and APIs for Python API, R API, and Java API.  By simplifying the complex landscape of ML workflows, MLflow empowers data scientists and developers to focus on building and refining models, ensuring a streamlined path from experimentation to production.

For example:\\\\n```python\\\\nimport mlflow\\\\n\\\\n# Load the custom pyfunc model\\\\nmodel = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\\\\\\\"custom_pyfunc_model\\\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n# Use the model to make predictions\\\\ninput_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(10, 5))\\\\npredictions = model.predict(input_data)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nBy following these steps, you can create a custom pyfunc model in MLflow that can be used for making predictions on new data.\\\", \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": {}, \\\"response_metadata\\\": {\\\"prompt_tokens\\\": 3569, \\\"completion_tokens\\\": 610, \\\"total_tokens\\\": 4179}, \\\"type\\\": \\\"ai\\\", \\\"name\\\": null, \\\"id\\\": \\\"run-a589f4dc-b8b9-4d55-8abe-5a60fed9429e-0\\\", \\\"example\\\": false, \\\"tool_calls\\\": [], \\\"invalid_tool_calls\\\": []}}]], \\\"llm_output\\\": {\\\"prompt_tokens\\\": 3569, \\\"completion_tokens\\\": 610, \\\"total_tokens\\\": 4179}, \\\"run\\\": null}\"}, \"events\": []}], \"request\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"How can I write a custom pyfunc?\\\"}\", \"response\": \"{\\\"result\\\": \\\"To create a custom pyfunc model in MLflow, you can follow these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Create a new directory for your custom pyfunc model. This directory should contain the following files:\\\\n* `MLmodel`: A configuration file that specifies the model type and any necessary dependencies.\\\\n* `conda.yaml`: A configuration file that specifies the Conda environment needed to run your model.\\\\n* `model.py`: A Python module that defines your custom pyfunc model class.\\\\n2. In the `MLmodel` file, specify the model type as `pyfunc` and list any necessary dependencies. For example:\\\\n```makefile\\\\nmodel_type: pyfunc\\\\n\\\\ndependencies:\\\\n  - python=3.8\\\\n  - pip:\\\\n    - mlflow\\\\n    - numpy\\\\n    - pandas\\\\n```\\\\n3. In the `conda.yaml` file, specify the Conda environment needed to run your model. For example:\\\\n```yaml\\\\nname: custom_pyfunc_env\\\\nchannels:\\\\n  - defaults\\\\ndependencies:\\\\n  - python=3.8\\\\n  - pip:\\\\n    - mlflow\\\\n    - numpy\\\\n    - pandas\\\\n```\\\\n4. In the `model.py` file, define your custom pyfunc model class. This class should inherit from the `mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` class and implement the `load_context` and `predict` methods. For example:\\\\n```python\\\\nimport mlflow\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\n\\\\nclass CustomPyfuncModel(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\\\\n    def load_context(self, context):\\\\n        self.model = context.artifacts[\\\\\\\"model\\\\\\\"]\\\\n\\\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\\\n        # Preprocess the input data\\\\n        input_data = model_input.to_numpy()\\\\n\\\\n        # Use the loaded model to make predictions\\\\n        predictions = self.model.predict(input_data)\\\\n\\\\n        # Postprocess the predictions\\\\n        predictions = pd.DataFrame(predictions, columns=[\\\\\\\"predictions\\\\\\\"])\\\\n\\\\n        return predictions\\\\n```\\\\n5. Save your custom pyfunc model to a directory using the `mlflow.pyfunc.save_model` function. For example:\\\\n```python\\\\nimport mlflow\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\n\\\\n# Create a custom pyfunc model\\\\nmodel = CustomPyfuncModel()\\\\n\\\\n# Save the model to a directory\\\\nmlflow.pyfunc.save_model(\\\\n    path=\\\\\\\"custom_pyfunc_model\\\\\\\",\\\\n    python_model=model,\\\\n    artifacts={\\\\\\\"model\\\\\\\": mlflow.get_artifact_uri(\\\\\\\"model\\\\\\\")}\\\\n)\\\\n```\\\\n6. Load your custom pyfunc model using the `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model` function. For example:\\\\n```python\\\\nimport mlflow\\\\n\\\\n# Load the custom pyfunc model\\\\nmodel = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\\\\\\\"custom_pyfunc_model\\\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n# Use the model to make predictions\\\\ninput_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(10, 5))\\\\npredictions = model.predict(input_data)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nBy following these steps, you can create a custom pyfunc model in MLflow that can be used for making predictions on new data.\\\"}\"}}, {\"info\": {\"request_id\": \"fce34fac5e0141f39ea5af7fcb38c547\", \"experiment_id\": \"0\", \"timestamp_ms\": 1716464555045,

Create a new directory for your custom pyfunc model. This directory should contain the following files:\\\\n* `MLmodel`: A configuration file that specifies the model type and any necessary dependencies.\\\\n* `conda.yaml`: A configuration file that specifies the Conda environment needed to run your model.\\\\n* `model.py`: A Python module that defines your custom pyfunc model class.\\\\n2. In the `MLmodel` file, specify the model type as `pyfunc` and list any necessary dependencies. For example:\\\\n```makefile\\\\nmodel_type: pyfunc\\\\n\\\\ndependencies:\\\\n  - python=3.8\\\\n  - pip:\\\\n    - mlflow\\\\n    - numpy\\\\n    - pandas\\\\n```\\\\n3. In the `conda.yaml` file, specify the Conda environment needed to run your model. For example:\\\\n```yaml\\\\nname: custom_pyfunc_env\\\\nchannels:\\\\n  - defaults\\\\ndependencies:\\\\n  - python=3.8\\\\n  - pip:\\\\n    - mlflow\\\\n    - numpy\\\\n    - pandas\\\\n```\\\\n4. In the `model.py` file, define your custom pyfunc model class. This class should inherit from the `mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` class and implement the `load_context` and `predict` methods. For example:\\\\n```python\\\\nimport mlflow\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\n\\\\nclass CustomPyfuncModel(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\\\\n    def load_context(self, context):\\\\n        self.model = context.artifacts[\\\\\"model\\\\\"]\\\\n\\\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\\\n        # Preprocess the input data\\\\n        input_data = model_input.to_numpy()\\\\n\\\\n        # Use the loaded model to make predictions\\\\n        predictions = self.model.predict(input_data)\\\\n\\\\n        # Postprocess the predictions\\\\n        predictions = pd.DataFrame(predictions, columns=[\\\\\"predictions\\\\\"])\\\\n\\\\n        return predictions\\\\n```\\\\n5. Save your custom pyfunc model to a directory using the `mlflow.pyfunc.save_model` function. For example:\\\\n```python\\\\nimport mlflow\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\n\\\\n# Create a custom pyfunc model\\\\nmodel = CustomPyfuncModel()\\\\n\\\\n# Save the model to a directory\\\\nmlflow.pyfunc.save_model(\\\\n    path=\\\\\"custom_pyfunc_model\\\\\",\\\\n    python_model=model,\\\\n    artifacts={\\\\\"model\\\\\": mlflow.get_artifact_uri(\\\\\"model\\\\\")}\\\\n)\\\\n```\\\\n6. Load your custom pyfunc model using the `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model` function. For example:\\\\n```python\\\\nimport mlflow\\\\n\\\\n# Load the custom pyfunc model\\\\nmodel = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\\\\\"custom_pyfunc_model\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n# Use the model to make predictions\\\\ninput_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(10, 5))\\\\npredictions = model.predict(input_data)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nBy following these steps, you can create a custom pyfunc model in MLflow that can be used for making predictions on new data.\"}')), Trace(info=TraceInfo(request_id='fce34fac5e0141f39ea5af7fcb38c547', experiment_id='0', timestamp_ms=1716464555045, execution_time_ms=6, status=<TraceStatus.OK: 'OK'>, request_metadata={'mlflow.traceInputs': '{\"input\": \"something\"}', 'mlflow.traceOutputs': '654546455345'}, tags={'mlflow.trace_schema.version': '2', 'mlflow.artifactLocation': 'file:///Users/harutaka.kawamura/Desktop/repositories/mlflow/mlruns/0/traces/fce34fac5e0141f39ea5af7fcb38c547/artifacts', 'mlflow.source.name': '/Users/harutaka.kawamura/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-latest/envs/mlflow/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py', 'mlflow.traceSpans': '[{\"name\": \"TEST\", \"type\": \"UNKNOWN\", \"inputs\": [\"input\"]}, {\"name\": \"CHILD\", \"type\": \"UNKNOWN\", \"inputs\": [\"foo\"]}]', 'mlflow.source.type': 'LOCAL', 'mlflow.traceName': 'TEST'}), data=TraceData(spans=[Span(name='TEST', request_id='fce34fac5e0141f39ea5af7fcb38c547', span_id='0x7b7af20ec91a911e', parent_id=None), Span(name='CHILD', request_id='fce34fac5e0141f39ea5af7fcb38c547', span_id='0xeb2eed185b387106', parent_id='0x7b7af20ec91a911e')], request='{\"input\": \"something\"}', response='654546455345')), Trace(info=TraceInfo(request_id='a03368ff6cf847c881f938277ee53c88', experiment_id='0', timestamp_ms=1716464546748, execution_time_ms=9, status=<TraceStatus.ERROR: 'ERROR'>, request_metadata={'mlflow.traceInputs': '', 'mlflow.traceOutputs': ''}, tags={'mlflow.trace_schema.version': '2', 'mlflow.artifactLocation': 'file:///Users/harutaka.kawamura/Desktop/repositories/mlflow/mlruns/0/traces/a03368ff6cf847c881f938277ee53c88/artifacts', 'mlflow.source.name': '/Users/harutaka.kawamura/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-latest/envs/mlflow/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py', 'mlflow.traceSpans': '[{\"name\": \"TEST\", \"type\": \"UNKNOWN\"}, {\"name\": \"CHILD\", \"type\": \"UNKNOWN\", \"inputs\": [\"foo\"]}]', 'mlflow.source.type': 'LOCAL', 'mlflow.traceName': 'TEST'}), data=TraceData(spans=[Span(name='TEST', request_id='a03368ff6cf847c881f938277ee53c88', span_id='0xad08803a729bbca7', parent_id=None), Span(name='CHILD', request_id='a03368ff6cf847c881f938277ee53c88', span_id='0xa5c4a44e8fc3f0ce', parent_id='0xad08803a729bbca7')], request=None, response=None)), Trace(info=TraceInfo(request_id='67ccd905c32a43c1af50e8fd781fde2b', experiment_id='0', timestamp_ms=1716464490166, execution_time_ms=7, status=<TraceStatus.ERROR: 'ERROR'>, request_metadata={'mlflow.traceInputs': '', 'mlflow.traceOutputs': ''}, tags={'mlflow.trace_schema.version': '2', 'mlflow.artifactLocation': 'file:///Users/harutaka.kawamura/Desktop/repositories/mlflow/mlruns/0/traces/67ccd905c32a43c1af50e8fd781fde2b/artifacts', 'mlflow.source.name': '/Users/harutaka.kawamura/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-latest/envs/mlflow/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py', 'mlflow.traceSpans': '[{\"name\": \"TEST\", \"type\": \"UNKNOWN\"}]', 'mlflow.source.type': 'LOCAL', 'mlflow.traceName': 'TEST'}), data=TraceData(spans=[Span(name='TEST', request_id='67ccd905c32a43c1af50e8fd781fde2b', span_id='0x9c437c1347e8bae3', parent_id=None)], request=None, response=None)), Trace(info=TraceInfo(request_id='e1574bc89124454e93caa7d50bb759d6', experiment_id='0', timestamp_ms=1716464460770, execution_time_ms=1590, status=<TraceStatus.OK: 'OK'>, request_metadata={'mlflow.traceInputs': '{\"model_input\": [{\"query\": \"What is in MLflow 5.0\"}], \"system_prompt\": \"\\\\nYou are an assistant for Databricks users.
