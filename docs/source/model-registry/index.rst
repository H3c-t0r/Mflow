MLflow Model Registry
=====================

The MLflow Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to
collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. It provides model lineage (which
MLflow experiment and run produced the model), model versioning, model aliasing, model tagging, and
annotations.

See here for a guide on how to use the Model Registry: https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html
