.. _quickstart_drilldown:

Quickstart additional material: Options and troubleshooting
===========================================================


.. 
    Hmm... At the moment, I have this as a single separate document.
    Other options would be to inline this below the 'next steps' section of the quickstart doc itself. That would probably be a net gain for SEO, at the expense of a longer doc. 

    The other option would be to have each section here as a separate doc, and link to them from the quickstart doc. Would that be a gain for SEO (doc is better than section?)
