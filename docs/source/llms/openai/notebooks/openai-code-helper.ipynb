    "### Defining and Utilizing the Model Signature in MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the tutorial, we define a `ModelSignature` for our OpenAI model, which is a crucial step in both saving the base model and later in our custom Python Model implementation. Here's an overview of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Signature Definition**:\n",
    "   - We create a `ModelSignature` object that specifies the input, output, and parameters of our model.\n",
    "   - The `inputs` and `outputs` are defined as schemas with a single string column, indicating that our model will be processing string type data.\n",
    "   - The `params` schema includes two parameters: `max_tokens` and `temperature`, each with a default value and data type defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Saving the Base OpenAI Model**:\n",
    "   - Using `mlflow.openai.save_model`, we save the base OpenAI model (`gpt-4`) along with the `instruction` set we defined earlier.\n",
    "   - The `signature` we defined is also passed in this step, ensuring that the model is saved with the correct specifications for inputs, outputs, and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual-purpose signature is vital as it ensures consistency in how the model processes data both in its base form and when it's later wrapped in a custom Python Model. This approach streamlines the workflow and maintains uniformity across different stages of model implementation and deployment."

    "### Enhancing User Experience with Custom Pyfunc Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduce a custom Python Model, `CodeHelper`, which significantly improves the user experience when interacting with the OpenAI model in an interactive development environment like Jupyter Notebook. The `CodeHelper` class is designed to format the output from the OpenAI model, making it more readable and visually appealing, similar to a chat interface. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization and Model Loading**:\n",
    "   - The `CodeHelper` class inherits from `PythonModel`.\n",
    "   - The `load_context` method is used to load the OpenAI model, which is saved as `self.model`. This model is loaded from the `context.artifacts`, ensuring that the appropriate model is used for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Response Formatting**:\n",
    "   - The `_format_response` method is crucial for enhancing the output format.\n",
    "   - It processes each item in the response, handling text and code blocks differently.\n",
    "   - Text lines outside of code blocks are wrapped to a width of 80 characters for better readability.\n",
    "   - Lines within code blocks (marked by `` ``` ``) are not wrapped, preserving the code structure.\n",
    "   - This formatting creates an output that resembles a chat interface, making the interaction more intuitive and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Making Predictions**:\n",
    "   - The `predict` method is where the modelâ€™s prediction occurs.\n",
    "   - It calls the loaded OpenAI model to get the raw response for the given input.\n",
    "   - The raw response is then passed to the `_format_response` method for formatting.\n",
    "   - The formatted response is returned, providing a clear and easy-to-read output.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing this custom `pyfunc`, we enhance the user's interaction with the AI code helper. It not only makes the output easier to understand but also presents it in a familiar format, akin to messaging, which is especially beneficial in interactive coding environments."

    "\n",
    "The `code_inspector` function is a Python decorator designed to augment functions with automatic code review capabilities using an MLflow pyfunc model. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decorator Function Setup**:\n",
    "   - `code_inspector` takes an MLflow model as an argument. This model is used to evaluate the code of any function it decorates.\n",
    "   - Inside, it defines `decorator_check_my_function`, a function that creates the actual decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wrapper Function**:\n",
    "   - `decorator_check_my_function` further defines `wrapper`, which will wrap around the original function.\n",
    "   - `wrapper` accepts arbitrary arguments and keyword arguments, allowing it to decorate any function.\n",
    "   - It uses `inspect.getsource` to extract the source code of the decorated function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Analysis and Feedback**:\n",
    "   - The source code is then analyzed by the MLflow model using `model.predict`.\n",
    "   - The model's feedback, which may include code improvements, error identification, or suggestions, is printed out.\n",
    "   - In case of exceptions during model prediction or formatting, the error is printed.\n",
    "   - After printing the feedback, `wrapper` executes the original function and returns its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Application**:\n",
    "   - Apply `code_inspector` as a decorator to functions for real-time code quality checks and feedback.\n",
    "   - This is particularly useful for learning and improving coding practices, as it provides insights into code quality and best practices.\n",

    "### First Usage Trial: The `summing_function` with `code_inspector`\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply the `code_inspector` decorator to a function named `summing_function`. This function is designed to calculate the sum of sums for a given range. Here's an insight into its functionality and the enhancement brought by `code_inspector`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Overview**:\n",
    "   - `summing_function` calculates the cumulative sum of numbers up to `n`. It does so by iterating over a range and summing the intermediate sums at each step.\n",
    "   - A dictionary, `intermediate_sums`, is used to store these sums, which are then aggregated to find the final sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `code_inspector`**:\n",
    "   - The function is decorated with `code_inspector(loaded_helper)`. This means that each time `summing_function` is called, the MLflow model loaded as `loaded_helper` analyzes its code.\n",
    "   - The decorator provides real-time feedback on the code, assessing aspects like quality, efficiency, and best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Educational Benefit**:\n",
    "   - This setup is ideal for learning, allowing users to receive instant, actionable feedback on their code.\n",
    "   - It offers a practical way to understand the logic behind the function and learn coding optimizations and improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating `code_inspector` with `summing_function`, the tutorial demonstrates an interactive approach to enhancing coding skills, with immediate feedback aiding in understanding and improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding to see the response from GPT-4, can you identify all of the issues in this code (there are more than a few)?"

    "### Execution and Analysis of `summing_function(1000)`\n",
    "\n",
    "When we execute `summing_function(1000)`, several key processes take place, utilizing our custom MLflow model through the `code_inspector` decorator. Here's what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decorator Activation**:\n",
    "   - On calling `summing_function(1000)`, the `code_inspector` decorator is the first to activate. This decorator is designed to use the `loaded_helper` model to analyze the decorated function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Analyzes the Function Code**:\n",
    "   - `code_inspector` retrieves the source code of `summing_function` using the `inspect` module.\n",
    "   - This source code is then passed to the `loaded_helper` model, which performs an analysis based on its training and provided instructions. The model predicts feedback on code quality, efficiency, and best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feedback Presentation**:\n",
    "   - The feedback generated by the model is printed out. This feedback might include suggestions for code optimization, identification of potential errors, or general advice on coding practices.\n",
    "   - This step provides an educational insight into the code quality before the function executes its logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function Execution**:\n",
    "   - After the feedback is displayed, the `summing_function` proceeds to execute with the input `1000`.\n",
    "   - The function calculates the cumulative sum of numbers up to 1000, but due to its inefficient implementation, this process may be slower and more resource-intensive than necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return of Result**:\n",
    "   - The function returns the final computed sum, which is the result of the summing logic implemented within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration highlights how the `code_inspector` decorator, combined with our custom MLflow model, provides a unique, real-time code analysis and feedback mechanism, enhancing the learning and development experience in an interactive environment."
