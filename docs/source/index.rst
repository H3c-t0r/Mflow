MLflow: A Tool for Managing the Machine Learning Lifecycle
==========================================================

MLflow is an open-source platform, purpose-built to assist machine learning practitioners and teams in
handling the complexities of the machine learning process. Mlflow focuses on the full lifecycle for
machine learning projects, ensuring that each phase is manageable, traceable, and reproducible.

Core Components of MLflow
-------------------------

* :ref:`Tracking <tracking>`: A centralized repository that allows for recording the history of model training. It captures parameters, metrics, artifacts, data and environment configurations, allowing teams to observe the evolution of their models over time.

* :ref:`Model Registry <registry>`: A systematic way to manage models. It helps in managing the state of different versions of models, understanding their current state, and facilitating smoother transitions from development stages to production deployments.

* :ref:`AI Gateway <gateway>`: A server and set of standard APIs that streamlines the access to both SaaS and OSS LLM models. It acts as a consistent interface, enhances security by handling authenticated access, and provides a simplified common set of APIs for leveraging popular LLMs.

* :ref:`Evaluate <model-evaluation>`: A set of tools designed for detailed model analysis. It provides functionalities to objectively compare different models, be they traditional ML algorithms or the most state-of-the-art LLMs.

* PromptLab: An environment dedicated to prompt engineering. It offers a space where users can experiment with, refine, and test prompts in isolation.

* :ref:`Recipes <recipes>`: A framework that guides users in structuring ML projects. While it offers recommendations, the goal is to ensure that the end results are not just functional but also optimized for real-world deployments.

Why Use MLflow?
---------------

The ML process can be intricate, with multiple stages and numerous considerations at each step.
MLflow aims to simplify this process by providing a unified platform where each phase of the ML lifecycle
is treated as a critical component. By doing so, it ensures:

- **Traceability**: With tools like the Tracking Server, every experiment is logged, ensuring that teams can trace back and understand the evolution of models.

- **Consistency**: Whether you're accessing models through the AI Gateway or structuring projects with MLflow Recipes, there's a consistent approach, reducing the learning curve and potential for errors.

- **Flexibility**: MLflow is designed to be library-agnostic, making it compatible with various machine learning libraries. Additionally, its functionalities are available across different programming languages, supported by a comprehensive :ref:`rest-api`, :ref:`CLI<cli>`, and APIs for :ref:`python-api`, :ref:`R-api`, and :ref:`java_api`.
