sklearn
============


Welcome to the developer guide for the integration of 
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ (sklearn) with MLflow. This guide serves as a comprehensive 
resource for understanding and leveraging the combined capabilities of sklearn and MLflow in 
developing advanced language model applications.


What is sklearn?
---------------
Sklearn is one of the most popular open-source machine learning libraries for Python. It is built on
top of Numpy, SciPy, and matplotlib and provides simple and efficient tools for data modeling and 
analysis. Common use cases of sklearn include classification, regression, and clustering.
The library also provides an impressive suite of dimensionality reduction, model selection, and 
preprocessing tools. 


Why use MLflow with sklearn?
---------------------------

MLflow makes model development with sklearn more effective. Below are common use cases where the
combination of MLflow and SKlearn is powerful:
* **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow records valuable information about your SKlearn training runs, 
  including the code that was run, the data that was used, configuration parameters, and the model 
  that was produced. This allows you to keep track of your experiments and compare their results.
* **Model Packaging**: MLflow provides a standardized API for saving and loading sklearn models and
  their environments, allowing you to easily package and deploy models across a variety of tools.
