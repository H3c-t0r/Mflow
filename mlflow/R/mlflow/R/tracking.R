#' Create Experiment
#'
#' Creates an MLflow experiment.
#'
#' @param name The name of the experiment to create.
#' @param artifact_location Location where all artifacts for this experiment are stored. If
#'   not provided, the remote server will select an appropriate default.
#'
#' @export

#' Create Run
#'
#' reate a new run within an experiment. A run is usually a single execution of a machine learning or data ETL pipeline.
#'
#' MLflow uses runs to track Param, Metric, and RunTag, associated with a single execution.
#'
#' @param experiment_id Unique identifier for the associated experiment.
#' @param user_id User ID or LDAP for the user executing the run.
#' @param run_name Human readable name for run.
#' @param source_type Originating source for this run. One of Notebook, Job, Project, Local or Unknown.
#' @param source_name String descriptor for source. For example, name or description of the notebook, or job name.
#' @param status Current status of the run. One of RUNNING, SCHEDULE, FINISHED, FAILED, KILLED.
#' @param start_time Unix timestamp of when the run started in milliseconds.
#' @param end_time Unix timestamp of when the run ended in milliseconds.
#' @param source_version Git version of the source code used to create run.
#' @param entry_point_name Name of the entry point for the run.
#' @param tags Additional metadata for run in key-value pairs.

#' Delete Experiment
#'
#' Mark an experiment and associated runs, params, metrics, â€¦ etc for deletion. If the
#'   experiment uses FileStore, artifacts associated with experiment are also deleted.
#'
#' @param experiment_id ID of the associated experiment This field is required.

#' Restore Experiment
#'
#' Restore an experiment marked for deletion. This also restores associated metadata,
#'   runs, metrics, and params. If experiment uses FileStore, underlying artifacts
#'   associated with experiment are also restored.
#'
#' Throws RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST if experiment was never created or was permanently deleted.
#'
#' @param experiment_id ID of the associated experiment This field is required.
