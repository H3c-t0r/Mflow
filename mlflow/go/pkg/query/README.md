# Search Query Syntax

Mlflow has a [query syntax](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/search-runs.html#search-query-syntax-deep-dive).

This package is meant to lex and parse this query dialect.

The code is based on the https://github.com/tlaceby/parser-series.
I recommend the video series on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V77J9l8N-P8&t=6s&ab_channel=tylerlaceby
