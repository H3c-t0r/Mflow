# Issue Policy
The MLflow Issue Policy outlines the categories of MLflow GitHub issues and discusses the guidelines & processes
associated with each type of issue.

Before filing an issue, make sure to [search for related issues](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues) and check if
they address yours. 

For support (ex. "How do I do X?"), please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).

## Issue Categories

Our policy is that GitHub issues fall into one of the following categories:

1. Bug reports
2. Documentation fixes
3. Feature requests
4. Installation issues

Each category has its own GitHub issue template. Please do not delete the issue template unless you are certain your
issue is outside its scope.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests typically go through the following lifecycle:

1. Submit feature request on GitHub issues containing a high-level description of the proposal and its motivation.
   We encourage requesters to provide an overview of the feature's implementation as well, if possible.
2. Discuss feature request with a committer, who will provide input on the implementation overview or ask for a more detailed design, if applicable.
3. After discussion & agreement on feature request, start implementation.
