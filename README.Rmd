[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/mlflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/mlflow) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/rstudio/mlflow?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JavierLuraschi/mlflow) [![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/mlflow)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlflow) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/rstudio/mlflow/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/rstudio/mlflow) 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "tools/readme/", dev = "png")
```

- Install [MLflow]() from R to track experiments locally.
- Connect to MLflow servers to share experiments with others.
- Use MLflow to export models that can be served locally and remotely.

## Installation

You can install **mlflow** from GitHub as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/mlflow")
```

Then, install MLflow to manage models and experiments locally:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(mlflow)
mlflow_install()
```

To upgrade to the latest version of mlflow, run the following command and restart your r session:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/mlflow")
```

## Experiments

You can create a new experiment locally using `mlflow` as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(mlflow)
mlflow_experiment_create("New Experiment")
```

Then you can list your experiments directly from R,

```{r}
mlflow_experiments()
```

or using MLflows user interface by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mlflow_ui(mc)
```

You can also use a MLflow server to track and share experiments, see [running a tracking server](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#running-a-tracking-server) and then make use of this server by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mlflow_tracking_url("http://tracking-server:5000")
```

Once th tracking url is defined, the experiments will be stored and tracked in the specified server which others can also access with ease.
