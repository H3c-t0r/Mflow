[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/mlflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/mlflow) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/rstudio/mlflow?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JavierLuraschi/mlflow) [![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/mlflow)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlflow) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/rstudio/mlflow/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/rstudio/mlflow) 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

- Install [MLflow]() from R to manage models and experiments locally.
- Connect to a remote MLflow server to share, deploy and serve models.

## Installation

You can install **mlflow** from GitHub as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/mlflow")
```

Then, install MLflow to manage models and experiments locally:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(mlflow)
mlflow_install()
```

To upgrade to the latest version of mlflow, run the following command and restart your r session:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/mlflow")
```

## Connecting

You can connect to both local instances of MLflow as well as remote MLflow servers. Here we'll connect to a local instance of MLflow via the `mlflow_connect()` function: 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(mlflow)
mc <- mlflow_connect()
```

You can then launch the MLflow user interface by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mlflow_ui(mc)
```

## Experiments

To list experiments, run:

```{r}
mlflow_experiments(mc)
```

## Termination

To terminate a local MLflow instance, restart your R session or run explicitly:

```{r}
mlflow_disconnect(mc)
```
