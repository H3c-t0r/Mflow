The files in this folder are used by `test_update_mlflow_versions.py`
to ensure that the script operates as expected. The test copies the
files from the "before" folder into a temp directory, then runs the
script on the temp directory.

The files in the "before" folder are generated by copying all the
files that the `dev/update_mlflow_versions.py` script is expected
to modify as of version 2.11.1dev0.

The files in the "after-pre" and "after-post" folders were generated by running:

`python dev/update_mlflow_version.py pre-release --new-version 2.11.1`
`python dev/update_mlflow_version.py post-release --new-version 2.11.1`

The files were then manually checked to ensure correctness. This isn't
a perfect solution, but it helps to ensure that we don't cause regressions
while making changes to the update script.
